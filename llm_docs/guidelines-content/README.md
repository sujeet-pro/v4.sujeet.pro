# LLM Content Guidelines (Canonical)

This folder is the single source of truth for **content** guidance (writing, research, markdown, persona).

Use these documents in order:

- content-structure.md
- content-guidelines.md
- research-and-fact-checking.md
- markdown-features.md
- persona.md

If any older docs conflict with this folder, the guidance here wins.

For **codebase changes**, use `llm_docs/guidelines-code/coding-standards.md`.
