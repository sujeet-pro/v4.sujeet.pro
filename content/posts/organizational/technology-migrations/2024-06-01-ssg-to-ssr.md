# Migrating E-commerce Platforms from SSG to SSR: A Strategic Architecture Transformation

## Abstract

This comprehensive guide outlines the strategic migration from Static Site Generation (SSG) to Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for enterprise e-commerce platforms. Drawing from real-world implementation experience where SSG limitations caused significant business impact including product rollout disruptions, ad rejections, and marketing campaign inefficiencies, this playbook addresses the critical business drivers, technical challenges, and operational considerations that make this architectural transformation essential for modern digital commerce. While our specific journey involved migrating from Gatsby.js to Next.js, the principles and strategies outlined here apply to any SSG-to-SSR migration. The guide covers stakeholder alignment, risk mitigation, phased execution using platform A/B testing, and post-migration optimization, providing a complete roadmap for engineers undertaking this transformative journey.

## Part 1: The Strategic Imperative - Building the Business Case for Migration

### Understanding the SSG Limitations in E-commerce

The decision to migrate from SSG to SSR stems from fundamental architectural limitations that become increasingly problematic as e-commerce platforms scale. While SSG excels at creating high-performance static websites, its build-time-first approach creates significant operational bottlenecks in dynamic commerce environments that directly impact business operations.

**Build-Time Bottlenecks and Operational Inefficiency**

For e-commerce platforms with large product catalogs and frequent content updates, the requirement to trigger full site rebuilds for every change creates unacceptable delays, creating direct friction for marketing and merchandising teams who need instant publishing capabilities. This dependency on engineering resources for simple content updates creates an organizational bottleneck that hinders business agility.

**Suboptimal Handling of Dynamic Content**

SSG's reliance on client-side rendering for dynamic content leads to degraded user experiences. Elements like personalized recommendations, real-time pricing, and inventory status "pop in" after the static shell loads, causing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) that negatively impacts both user perception and SEO rankings.

**Content Creation and Preview Workflows**

The difficulty of providing content teams with reliable, instant previews of their changes creates significant friction in the content lifecycle. Workarounds like maintaining separate development servers or complex CMS workflows introduce operational overhead and increase the likelihood of production errors.

### The Business Impact of SSG Limitations - Real-World Production Experience

**Critical Business Problems from Actual Implementation**

Based on real production experience with our SSG implementation, several critical issues emerged that directly impacted revenue and operational efficiency:

- **Product Rollout Disruptions**: Code and content are bundled as one snapshot, meaning any code issue requiring rollback also removes newly launched products, resulting in 404 errors and lost marketing spend. Fix-forward approaches take 2+ hours, during which email campaigns and marketing spend are wasted on broken product pages.

- **Product Retirement Complexity**: Retired products require external redirection management via Lambda functions, creating inconsistencies between redirects and in-app navigation, leading to poor user experience and potential SEO issues.

- **Ad Rejection Issues**: Static pricing at build time creates mismatches between cached HTML and client-side updates, leading to Google Ads rejections. The workaround of using `img.onError` callbacks and `data-pricing` attributes for DOM manipulation before React initialization is fragile and unsustainable.

- **Marketing Campaign Limitations**: Inability to optimize campaigns based on real-time inventory status, with all products appearing as "In Stock" in cached content. Client-side updates create CLS issues and poor user experience.

- **A/B Testing Scalability**: Page-level A/B testing becomes unfeasible due to template complexity and build-time constraints. Component-level A/B testing below the fold is possible but above-the-fold personalization affects SEO and causes CLS issues.

- **Personalization Constraints**: Above-the-fold personalization impossible without affecting SEO and causing CLS issues. Below-the-fold personalization requires client-side loading which impacts performance.

- **Responsive Design CLS Issues**: For content that differs between mobile and desktop, CLS is inevitable since build time can only generate one default version. Client-side detection and content switching creates layout shifts that negatively impact Core Web Vitals and user experience.

**Operational and Cost Issues**

- **Occasional Increased CloudFront Costs**: Home page launches with 200+ products caused ~10x cost for the day when content exceeded 10MB and couldn't be cached effectively.

- **Content-Code Coupling**: Marketing teams cannot publish content independently, requiring engineering coordination for simple banner updates and page launches.

- **Time-Based Release Complexity**: Managing multiple content changes for a single page becomes problematic when all changes must be published simultaneously.

### SSR as the Strategic Solution

**Dynamic Rendering for Modern Commerce**

SSR provides a flexible, dynamic rendering model that directly addresses each of these challenges:

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Enables real-time data fetching for dynamic content like pricing and inventory
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Combines the performance benefits of static generation with the freshness of dynamic updates
- **Edge Middleware**: Enables sophisticated routing, personalization, and A/B testing decisions at the edge
- **API Routes**: Built-in backend functionality for handling forms, cart management, and third-party integrations

**Quantifiable Business Benefits**

The migration from SSG to SSR delivers measurable improvements across key business metrics:

- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: Expected 5-10% increase through faster load times, better personalization, and stable UI
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: Projected 8-12% improvement from reduced CPC, higher conversion rates, and fewer ad rejections

## Part 4: The Strangler Fig Pattern - Phased Rollout Strategy with Platform A/B Testing

### Why Not "Big Bang" Migration?

A single cutover approach is unacceptably risky for mission-critical e-commerce platforms. The Strangler Fig pattern enables incremental migration with continuous value delivery and risk mitigation.

**Architecture Overview**

- **Routing Layer**: Edge middleware directing traffic between legacy and new systems
- **Gradual Replacement**: Piece-by-piece migration of site sections
- **Immediate Rollback**: Simple configuration changes for issue resolution
- **Platform A/B Testing**: Serve X% of users from SSR while maintaining SSG for others

### Platform A/B Testing Implementation

**Traffic Distribution Strategy**

The platform A/B approach allows for controlled, gradual migration:

- **User Segmentation**: Route users based on user ID hash, geographic location, or other deterministic criteria
- **Traffic Percentage Control**: Start with 5% of users on SSR, gradually increase to 100%
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track performance metrics for both platforms simultaneously
- **Instant Rollback**: Switch traffic back to SSG within minutes if issues arise

**Implementation Details**

```typescript
// Edge middleware for traffic distribution
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const userId = getUserId(request)
  const userHash = hashUserId(userId)
  const trafficPercentage = getTrafficPercentage() // Configurable

  if (userHash % 100 < trafficPercentage) {
    // Route to SSR (new platform)
    return NextResponse.next()
  } else {
    // Route to SSG (legacy platform)
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL("/legacy" + request.nextUrl.pathname))
  }
}
```

**Benefits of Platform A/B Testing**
