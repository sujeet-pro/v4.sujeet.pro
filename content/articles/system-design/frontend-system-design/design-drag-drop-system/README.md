# Draft: Design a Drag and Drop System

Building drag and drop interactions in web applications.

## TLDR

- Drag events require careful cross-browser handling
- Touch support extends to mobile devices
- Accessibility requires keyboard alternatives

## Outline

1. Drag events: dragstart, dragover, drop
2. Touch support: touch events, pointer events
3. Drop zones: valid targets, hover indication
4. Reordering: list reordering, tree reordering
5. Cross-list drag: moving between containers
6. Drag preview: custom drag images, ghost elements
7. Accessibility: keyboard alternatives
8. Libraries: react-dnd, dnd-kit, Sortable.js
