# Draft: Design a Form Builder

Building dynamic form generation systems.

## TLDR

- Form schemas define fields and validation rules
- Conditional logic enables dynamic forms
- Nested forms handle complex data structures

## Outline

1. Form schema: field definitions, validation rules
2. Dynamic rendering: schema-to-UI mapping
3. Field types: text, select, date, custom components
4. Validation: synchronous, asynchronous, cross-field
5. Conditional logic: field visibility, dynamic options
6. Nested forms: arrays, objects, repeatable sections
7. Form state: controlled vs uncontrolled
8. Persistence: draft saving, autosave
