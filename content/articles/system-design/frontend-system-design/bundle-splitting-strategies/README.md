# Draft: Bundle Splitting Strategies

Optimizing JavaScript bundle delivery for faster page loads.

## TLDR

- Code splitting reduces initial bundle size
- Route-based splitting loads code on demand
- Prefetching anticipates user navigation

## Outline

1. Code splitting fundamentals: reducing initial bundle
2. Route-based splitting: lazy loading routes
3. Component-based splitting: dynamic imports
4. Vendor splitting: separating dependencies
5. Prefetching: anticipating navigation
6. Preloading: critical resources
7. Bundle analysis: identifying optimization opportunities
8. Build tool configuration: Webpack, Vite, esbuild
