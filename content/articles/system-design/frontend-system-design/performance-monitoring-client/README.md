# Draft: Client Performance Monitoring

Measuring and monitoring frontend performance in production.

## TLDR

- Core Web Vitals measure real user experience
- RUM captures field data from actual users
- Custom metrics track business-specific goals

## Outline

1. Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID/INP, CLS
2. Performance API: timing, resource timing, long tasks
3. Real User Monitoring (RUM): collecting field data
4. Synthetic monitoring: lab data, Lighthouse
5. Error tracking: capturing, grouping, alerting
6. Session replay: reproducing user sessions
7. Custom metrics: business-specific measurements
8. Performance dashboards: visualization, alerting
