# Draft: Failure Modes and Resilience Patterns

Recognize and mitigate failures in distributed systems.

## TLDR

- Failures are inevitable; design for graceful degradation
- Redundancy and isolation limit blast radius
- Chaos testing validates resilience

## Outline

1. Common failure modes
2. Redundancy and isolation strategies
3. Retry, timeout, and fallback patterns
4. Chaos testing and game days
5. Incident response and runbooks
6. Resilience checklist
