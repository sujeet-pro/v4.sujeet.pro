1. Evolution: monolith to microservices
2. Domain boundaries: how to split services
3. Service mesh: managing service communication
4. Observability: distributed tracing at scale
5. Reliability: handling partial failures
6. Developer experience: tooling, deployment
7. Lessons learned: when to split, when to merge
