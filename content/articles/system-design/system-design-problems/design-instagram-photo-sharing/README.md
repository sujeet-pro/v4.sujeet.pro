# Draft: Design Instagram Photo Sharing

Building a photo-sharing social platform like Instagram.

## TLDR

- Image processing pipeline handles multiple resolutions
- Feed generation balances freshness and relevance
- Stories require ephemeral content handling

## Outline

1. Image upload: processing pipeline, multiple resolutions
2. Feed generation: pull vs push, fanout strategies
3. Stories: ephemeral content, 24-hour expiration
4. Explore page: content discovery, personalization
5. Direct messaging: real-time chat integration
6. Notifications: engagement notifications, batching
7. Search: hashtags, users, locations
