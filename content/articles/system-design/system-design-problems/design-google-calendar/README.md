# Draft: Design Google Calendar

Building a calendar and scheduling application.

## TLDR

- Recurring events require complex rule handling
- Time zone management is critical for global users
- Availability queries enable scheduling

## Outline

1. Event model: single, recurring, all-day events
2. Recurring events: RRULE, exceptions, modifications
3. Availability: free/busy queries, scheduling
4. Reminders: notification scheduling
5. Time zones: handling, display, DST
6. Sharing: calendar sharing, delegation
7. Invitations: RSVP, attendee management
