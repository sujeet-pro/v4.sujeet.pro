# Draft: Design Collaborative Docs (Google Docs)

Real-time collaboration with conflict resolution and offline support.

## TLDR

- Real-time editing relies on OT or CRDTs
- Latency and offline support require local-first design
- Access control and version history are critical

## Outline

1. Functional requirements and scale assumptions
2. Collaboration model: OT vs CRDT
3. Sync protocol and presence
4. Conflict resolution and history
5. Storage and indexing
6. Security and access control
