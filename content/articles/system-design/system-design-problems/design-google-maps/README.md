# Draft: Design Google Maps

Building a mapping and navigation platform.

## TLDR

- Tile-based rendering enables efficient map display
- Traffic-aware routing provides accurate ETAs
- Offline maps require careful tile management

## Outline

1. Map rendering: tile-based, vector tiles, zoom levels
2. Data model: roads, points of interest, boundaries
3. Routing: graph algorithms, A*, Dijkstra, traffic-aware
4. Traffic data: real-time, historical, prediction
5. Search: geocoding, reverse geocoding, POI search
6. Offline maps: tile downloading, compression
7. Updates: map data freshness, user contributions
