# Draft: CDN Architecture and Edge Caching

How CDNs reduce latency, protect origins, and handle global traffic.

## TLDR

- CDNs cache content near users to reduce RTT
- Cache keys and invalidation control correctness
- Edge compute enables personalization and security

## Outline

1. CDN fundamentals and request flow
2. Cache key design and variation
3. TTL, purge, and invalidation strategies
4. Origin shielding and tiered caching
5. Edge compute and security features
6. Monitoring hit rate and cost
