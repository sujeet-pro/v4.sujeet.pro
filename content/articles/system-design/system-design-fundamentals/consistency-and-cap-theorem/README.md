# Draft: Consistency Models and the CAP Theorem

Understand the tradeoffs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

## TLDR

- CAP forces a choice during network partitions
- Consistency models range from strong to eventual
- User experience often guides the right tradeoff

## Outline

1. CAP theorem fundamentals
2. Consistency model spectrum
3. Conflict resolution patterns
4. Choosing tradeoffs by use case
5. Latency and availability impacts
6. Testing for consistency behavior
