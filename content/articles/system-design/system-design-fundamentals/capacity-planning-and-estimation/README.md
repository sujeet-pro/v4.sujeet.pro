# Draft: Capacity Planning and Back-of-the-Envelope Estimates

Quick estimation techniques to validate scalability assumptions.

## TLDR

- Use order-of-magnitude math to sanity-check designs
- Focus on QPS, storage, and bandwidth first
- Document assumptions to guide tradeoffs

## Outline

1. Estimation methodology
2. Traffic and QPS calculations
3. Storage and bandwidth sizing
4. Cache hit-rate assumptions
5. Scaling with growth projections
6. Communicating assumptions
