# Draft: Service Discovery and Registry Patterns

How services find each other reliably in dynamic environments.

## TLDR

- Discovery can be client-side or server-side
- Registries need health and lifecycle management
- DNS-based discovery is simple but limited

## Outline

1. Service discovery models
2. Registry design and health checks
3. DNS-based discovery tradeoffs
4. Sidecars and service mesh patterns
5. Security and access control
6. Operational considerations
