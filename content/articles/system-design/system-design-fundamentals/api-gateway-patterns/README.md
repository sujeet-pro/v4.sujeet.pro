# Draft: API Gateway Patterns: Routing, Auth, and Policies

Centralized gateways for routing, security, and policy enforcement.

## TLDR

- Gateways simplify clients but add a critical dependency
- Policy enforcement includes auth, rate limits, and transforms
- Observability at the gateway is essential

## Outline

1. Gateway responsibilities and anti-patterns
2. Routing, versioning, and traffic shaping
3. Authentication and authorization integration
4. Rate limiting and quota enforcement
5. Caching and edge placement
6. Scaling and high availability
