# Draft: Service Workers and Cache API

Offline-first patterns, caching strategies, and update flows with service workers.

## TLDR

- Service workers intercept requests and enable offline experiences
- Cache API supports runtime and precache strategies
- Update lifecycle management prevents stale or broken clients

## Outline

1. Service worker lifecycle and scope
2. Cache API basics and storage strategy
3. Caching patterns: cache-first, network-first, stale-while-revalidate
4. Update flows and client coordination
5. Offline fallbacks and UX considerations
6. Debugging and observability
