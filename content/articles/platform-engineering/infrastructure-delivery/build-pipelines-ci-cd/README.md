# Draft: Build Pipelines and CI/CD Architecture

Designing fast, reliable build and deployment pipelines.

## TLDR

- Pipeline speed depends on caching and parallelism
- Artifact integrity and provenance are critical
- Fail-fast checks prevent expensive rebuilds

## Outline

1. Pipeline stages and responsibilities
2. Caching, artifacts, and reproducibility
3. Testing strategy and quality gates
4. Security scanning and supply chain controls
5. Deployment integrations
6. Metrics and optimization
