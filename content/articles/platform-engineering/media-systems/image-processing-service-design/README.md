# Image Processing Service Design: CDN, Transforms, and APIs

This document presents the architectural design for a cloud-agnostic, multi-tenant image processing platform that provides on-the-fly transformations with enterprise-grade security, performance, and cost optimization. The platform supports hierarchical multi-tenancy (Organization → Tenant → Space), public and private image delivery, and deployment across AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premise infrastructure. Key capabilities include deterministic transformation caching to ensure sub-second delivery, HMAC-SHA256 signed URLs for secure private access, CDN (Content Delivery Network) integration for global edge caching, and a "transform-once-serve-forever" approach that minimizes processing costs while guaranteeing HTTP 200 responses even for first-time transformation requests.

## Abstract

Image processing at scale requires balancing three competing concerns: **latency** (users expect sub-second delivery), **cost** (processing and storage grow with traffic), and **correctness** (transformations must be deterministic and secure). This architecture resolves these tensions through a layered caching strategy with content-addressed storage.

<figure>

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Cache Layers"
        CDN["CDN Edge\n95% hit rate"]
        Redis["Redis\n80% of misses"]
        DB["DB Index\n90% of remainder"]
        Process["Transform\n< 5% of requests"]
    end

    Request --> CDN
    CDN -->|5% miss| Redis
    Redis -->|20% miss| DB
    DB -->|10% miss| Process
    Process -->|store| DB
```

<figcaption>Multi-layer caching eliminates 99.9% of redundant processing—only the first request for each unique transformation hits the Transform Engine.</figcaption>

</figure>

**Core mental model:**

1. **Content-addressed storage**: Hash(original + operations) → unique derived asset. Same inputs always produce the same output, enabling infinite caching.
2. **Synchronous-first with async fallback**: Transform inline for < 5MB images (< 800ms). Queue larger images but return 202 with polling URL.
3. **Efficiency locks, not safety locks**: Redlock prevents duplicate processing but doesn't guarantee mutual exclusion. If two transforms race, both succeed—we just store one.
4. **Hierarchical policies**: Organization → Tenant → Space inheritance. Override at any level. Enforce at every layer (API, database, CDN).

**Technology selection rationale:**

| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Image processor  | Sharp 0.34+ (libvips) | 26x faster than jimp, 4-5x faster than ImageMagick, ~50MB memory per worker               |
| Distributed lock | Redlock               | Sufficient for efficiency (not correctness); simpler than etcd/ZooKeeper                  |
| Formats          | AVIF → WebP → JPEG    | AVIF: 94.89% browser support, 50% smaller than JPEG. WebP: 95.93% support, 25-34% savings |

| Technology          | Pros                                                     | Cons                       | Recommendation             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Sharp (libvips)** | 26x faster than jimp, low memory (~50MB), modern formats | Linux-focused build        | ✅ **Recommended**         |
| ImageMagick         | Feature-rich, mature                                     | 4-5x slower than Sharp     | Use for complex operations |
| Jimp                | Pure JavaScript, portable                                | Very slow, limited formats | Development only           |

**Choice**: **Sharp 0.34+** (latest: 0.34.5, November 2025) with libvips 8.18 for primary processing.

**Why Sharp over alternatives:**

- **Performance**: 64.42 ops/sec for JPEG processing on x64, 49.20 ops/sec on ARM64 (benchmarked without libvips caching; production performance higher)
- **Memory efficiency**: Uses streaming and memory-mapped I/O; set `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX="2"` on Linux to reduce glibc fragmentation
- **Modern format support**: AVIF, WebP, and as of libvips 8.18: UltraHDR (for HDR displays), Camera RAW via libraw, Oklab colorspace (CSS4-standard, faster than CIELAB)

**libvips 8.18 (December 2025) notable additions:**

- **UltraHDR**: Single image file displays optimally on both SDR and HDR screens via Google's libultrahdr
- **Camera RAW**: 28% faster and 40% less memory than ImageMagick when resizing CR2/NEF files
- **BigTIFF output**: Support for TIFF files > 4GB

| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Redlock (Redis)** | Simple, Redis-based          | No fencing tokens, clock skew risk | ✅ For efficiency only |
| etcd                | Linearizable, fencing tokens | Separate service, higher latency   | Safety-critical use    |
| ZooKeeper           | Strong consistency, mature   | Complex operations, JVM dependency | Safety-critical use    |
| Database locks      | Simple, transactional        | Contention, less scalable          | Development only       |

**Choice**: **Redlock** with Redis for transform deduplication (efficiency), **not** for safety-critical mutual exclusion.

**Why Redlock is sufficient here:**

The image service uses locks to prevent duplicate work, not to prevent data corruption. If two workers race past the lock:

1. Both fetch the original image
2. Both apply the same transformation (deterministic)
3. Both attempt to store the result
4. One wins (upsert semantics), the other's write is a no-op

This is inefficient (wasted compute) but not incorrect. The content-addressed storage ensures idempotency.

**Why Redlock is insufficient for safety-critical scenarios** (per [Martin Kleppmann's analysis](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html)):

1. **No fencing tokens**: Cannot generate monotonically increasing tokens to detect stale lock holders after process pauses/GC stops
2. **Timing assumptions**: Depends on bounded network delays and clock accuracy that frequently break in practice
3. **Clock vulnerabilities**: Uses `gettimeofday()` (not monotonic); NTP adjustments can cause time jumps

**Redis's current recommendation** (from [official docs](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/patterns/distributed-locks/)): Use N=5 Redis masters with majority voting, implement fencing tokens separately if correctness matters, monitor clock drift.

```bash
npm install redlock
```

### Edge Authentication Patterns

Modern CDNs support signature validation at the edge, eliminating origin round-trips for private content. This section covers three deployment patterns with different security/complexity tradeoffs.

**Pattern 1: Origin-based validation (simplest)**

All requests hit the origin, which validates signatures. The CDN caches responses keyed by the full URL including signature parameters.

- **Pros**: Simple deployment, no edge configuration
- **Cons**: Every unique signed URL generates a cache miss, origin must handle all validation
- **When to use**: Low traffic, simple deployments, or when CDN doesn't support edge compute

**Pattern 2: Edge signature validation with normalized cache keys**

The edge validates the signature, then strips signature parameters before checking the cache. This allows multiple signed URLs for the same content to share a single cache entry.

```javascript title="cloudflare-worker-auth.js" collapse={1-5, 25-40}
// Cloudflare Worker for edge signature validation
// Workers run on V8 isolates: ~1/10th memory of Node.js, <5ms cold start

export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url)

    // Extract and validate signature
    const sig = url.searchParams.get("sig")
    const exp = url.searchParams.get("exp")
    const kid = url.searchParams.get("kid")

    if (!sig || !exp || !kid) {
      return new Response("Missing signature", { status: 401 })
    }

    // Check expiration
    if (Date.now() / 1000 > parseInt(exp)) {
      return new Response("Signature expired", { status: 401 })
    }

    // Validate HMAC (key fetched from Workers KV or secrets)
    const key = await env.SIGNING_KEYS.get(kid)
    if (!key) {
      return new Response("Invalid key", { status: 401 })
    }

    // Reconstruct canonical string and verify
    const canonical = createCanonicalString(url.pathname, exp, url.hostname)
    const expected = await computeHmac(key, canonical)

    if (!timingSafeEqual(sig, expected)) {
      return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 })
    }

    // Strip signature params for cache key normalization
    url.searchParams.delete("sig")
    url.searchParams.delete("exp")
    url.searchParams.delete("kid")

    // Fetch from origin/cache with normalized URL
    return fetch(url.toString(), {
      cf: { cacheKey: url.toString() }, // Normalized cache key
    })
  },
}
```

- **Pros**: High cache efficiency, reduced origin load, sub-5ms auth latency
- **Cons**: Requires edge compute (CloudFlare Workers, CloudFront Functions, Fastly Compute)
- **When to use**: High-traffic private content, latency-sensitive applications

**Pattern 3: JWT tokens with edge validation**

Use JWT (JSON Web Token) instead of HMAC signatures. The edge can decode and validate JWTs without origin contact, and the token can carry claims (user ID, tenant ID, allowed operations).

- **Pros**: Self-contained tokens with embedded claims, standard format
- **Cons**: Larger URLs, no revocation without short expiry or edge-stored blocklist
- **When to use**: When tokens need to carry user context, or when integrating with existing JWT infrastructure

## URL Design

### URL Structure Philosophy

URLs should be:

1. **Self-describing**: Clearly indicate access mode (public vs private)
2. **Cacheable**: CDN-friendly with stable cache keys
3. **Deterministic**: Same transformation = same URL
4. **Human-readable**: Easy to understand and debug

### URL Patterns

#### Public Images

```
Format:
https://{cdn-domain}/v1/pub/{org}/{tenant}/{space}/img/{asset-id}/v{version}/{operations}.{ext}

Examples:
- Original:
  https://img.example.com/v1/pub/acme/website/marketing/img/01JBXYZ.../v1/original.jpg

- Resized:
  https://img.example.com/v1/pub/acme/website/marketing/img/01JBXYZ.../v1/w_800-h_600-f_cover.webp

- With preset:
  https://img.example.com/v1/pub/acme/website/marketing/img/01JBXYZ.../v1/preset_thumbnail.webp

- Format auto-negotiation:
  https://img.example.com/v1/pub/acme/website/marketing/img/01JBXYZ.../v1/w_1200-f_auto-q_auto.jpg
```

#### Private Images (Base URL)

```
Format:
https://{cdn-domain}/v1/priv/{org}/{tenant}/{space}/img/{asset-id}/v{version}/{operations}.{ext}

Example:
https://img.example.com/v1/priv/acme/internal/confidential/img/01JBXYZ.../v1/w_800-h_600.jpg
```

#### Private Images (Signed URL)

```
Format:
{base-url}?sig={signature}&exp={unix-timestamp}&kid={key-id}

Example:
https://img.example.com/v1/priv/acme/internal/confidential/img/01JBXYZ.../v1/w_800-h_600.jpg?sig=dGVzdHNpZ25hdHVyZQ&exp=1731427200&kid=key_123

Components:
- sig: Base64URL-encoded HMAC-SHA256 signature
- exp: Unix timestamp (seconds) when URL expires
- kid: Key ID for signature rotation support
```

### Transformation Parameters

Operations are encoded as hyphen-separated key-value pairs:

```
Parameter Format: {key}_{value}

Supported Parameters:
- w_{pixels}         : Width (e.g., w_800)
- h_{pixels}         : Height (e.g., h_600)
- f_{mode}           : Fit mode - cover, contain, fill, inside, outside, pad
- q_{quality}        : Quality 1-100 or 'auto' (e.g., q_85)
- fmt_{format}       : Format - jpg, png, webp, avif, gif, 'auto'
- r_{degrees}        : Rotation - 90, 180, 270
- g_{gravity}        : Crop gravity - center, north, south, east, west, etc.
- b_{color}          : Background color for pad (e.g., b_ffffff)
- blur_{radius}      : Blur radius 0.3-1000 (e.g., blur_5)
- sharpen_{amount}   : Sharpen amount 0-10 (e.g., sharpen_2)
- bw                 : Convert to black & white (grayscale)
- flip               : Flip horizontal
- flop               : Flip vertical
- preset_{name}      : Apply named preset

Examples:
- w_800-h_600-f_cover-q_85
- w_400-h_400-f_contain-fmt_webp
- preset_thumbnail
- w_1200-sharpen_2-fmt_webp-q_90
- w_800-h_600-f_pad-b_ffffff
```

### Operation Canonicalization

To ensure cache hit consistency, operations must be canonicalized:

```javascript title="canonicalize-operations.js"
/**
 * Canonicalizes transformation operations to ensure consistent cache keys
 */
function canonicalizeOperations(opsString) {
  const ops = parseOperations(opsString)

  // Apply defaults
  if (!ops.quality && ops.format !== "png") ops.quality = 85
  if (!ops.fit && (ops.width || ops.height)) ops.fit = "cover"

  // Normalize values
  if (ops.quality) ops.quality = Math.max(1, Math.min(100, ops.quality))
  if (ops.width) ops.width = Math.floor(ops.width)
  if (ops.height) ops.height = Math.floor(ops.height)

  // Canonical order: fmt, w, h, f, g, b, q, r, sharpen, blur, bw, flip, flop
  const order = ["fmt", "w", "h", "f", "g", "b", "q", "r", "sharpen", "blur", "bw", "flip", "flop"]

  return order
    .filter((key) => ops[key] !== undefined)
    .map((key) => `${key}_${ops[key]}`)
    .join("-")
}
```

### Cost Projection

For a service serving **10 million requests/month**:

| Component      | Without Optimization   | With Optimization       | Savings |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| **Processing** | 1M transforms × $0.001 | 50K transforms × $0.001 | 95%     |
| **Storage**    | 100TB × $0.023         | 100TB × $0.013 (tiered) | 43%     |
| **Bandwidth**  | 100TB × $0.09 (origin) | 100TB × $0.02 (CDN)     | 78%     |
| **CDN**        | —                      | 100TB × $0.02           | —       |
| **Total**      | **$12,300/month**      | **$5,400/month**        | **56%** |

Key optimizations:

- **95% CDN hit rate** reduces origin bandwidth
- **Transform deduplication** prevents reprocessing
- **Storage tiering** moves cold data to cheaper tiers
- **Smart caching** minimizes processing costs

## Failure Modes and Edge Cases

This section documents failure scenarios, their detection, and recovery strategies. Understanding these modes is critical for production operations.

### Transform Timeout (> 800ms SLA breach)

**Cause**: Large images (> 5MB), complex operations (multiple resize + effects), cold storage retrieval, or resource contention.

**Detection**: `transform_duration_seconds` histogram exceeds p95 threshold.

**Mitigation strategies**:

1. **Size-based routing**: Queue images > 5MB to async workers, return 202 with polling URL
2. **Operation limits**: Cap maximum output dimensions (e.g., 4096×4096), reject excessive blur/sharpen values
3. **Timeout with fallback**: Return lower-quality transform or original if timeout approaches
4. **Pre-warm cold storage**: Move frequently accessed cold-tier assets back to hot tier proactively

```javascript title="timeout-handling.js" collapse={1-5, 25-35}
async function transformWithTimeout(assetId, operations, timeoutMs = 750) {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeoutMs)

  try {
    return await transform(assetId, operations, { signal: controller.signal })
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === "AbortError") {
      // Return degraded response or queue for async processing
      metrics.transformTimeouts.inc({ org: assetId.split("/")[0] })

      // Option 1: Return original (fastest fallback)
      return { fallback: "original", reason: "timeout" }

      // Option 2: Queue and return 202
      // await queue.publish('transforms', { assetId, operations })
      // return { status: 202, pollUrl: `/v1/transforms/${jobId}` }
    }
    throw error
  } finally {
    clearTimeout(timeout)
  }
}
```

### Storage Tier Restoration Latency

**Cold storage retrieval** (Glacier, Coldline, Archive) adds 1-12 hours of latency. This breaks the synchronous transform guarantee.

**Mitigation**:

1. **Tier tracking in database**: `derived_assets.cache_tier` column indicates current storage tier
2. **Proactive restoration**: Cron job restores cold assets with recent `last_accessed_at` updates
3. **Graceful degradation**: For cold original assets, return 202 and trigger async restoration

```sql title="cold-restoration-query.sql"
-- Find cold assets accessed recently that should be restored
SELECT id, storage_key, cache_tier
FROM derived_assets
WHERE cache_tier = 'cold'
  AND last_accessed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY access_count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### CDN Cache Invalidation Failures

**Scenario**: Asset updated, but stale version persists in CDN edge caches.

**Root causes**:

- Invalidation API rate limits exceeded
- Propagation delays (CDNs quote 0-60 seconds, but outliers exist)
- Wildcard invalidation missed specific paths

**Mitigation**:

1. **Version in URL**: Include asset version (`/v{version}/`) so updates get new cache keys automatically
2. **Soft purge with fallback**: Use CDN's stale-while-revalidate to serve stale during revalidation
3. **Invalidation monitoring**: Track invalidation success rates and propagation times
4. **Dual-write period**: For critical updates, serve from origin for 60 seconds before relying on CDN

### Lock Contention Under Load

**Scenario**: Multiple workers compete for the same transform lock, causing lock acquisition timeouts.

**Detection**: `redlock_acquisition_failures` metric spikes, `lock_wait_time` increases.

**Mitigation**:

1. **Lock-free fast path**: Check if transform exists before acquiring lock (optimistic check)
2. **Retry with jitter**: Exponential backoff with randomized jitter to prevent thundering herd
3. **Lock timeout tuning**: Set lock TTL to 2x expected transform time, not a fixed value
4. **Shard by hash prefix**: Distribute lock contention across multiple Redis masters

### Partial Upload / Corrupt Original

**Scenario**: Upload interrupted, storage contains partial file, transform fails with cryptic libvips error.

**Detection**: Sharp throws `VipsError` on invalid input; content hash doesn't match expected.

**Mitigation**:

1. **Hash verification on upload**: Compute SHA-256 during upload, verify before marking complete
2. **Input validation**: Check magic bytes and basic structure before transformation
3. **Graceful error messages**: Map libvips errors to user-friendly responses

```javascript title="input-validation.js" collapse={1-3}
import sharp from "sharp"

async function validateImage(buffer) {
  try {
    const metadata = await sharp(buffer).metadata()

    // Check for reasonable dimensions
    if (metadata.width > 50000 || metadata.height > 50000) {
      return { valid: false, error: "Image dimensions exceed maximum (50000×50000)" }
    }

    // Check for minimum size (likely corrupt if too small)
    if (buffer.length < 100) {
      return { valid: false, error: "Image file too small, possibly corrupt" }
    }

    return { valid: true, metadata }
  } catch (error) {
    return { valid: false, error: `Invalid image: ${error.message}` }
  }
}
```

### Rate Limit Exhaustion

**Scenario**: Burst traffic exhausts rate limits, legitimate requests rejected.

**Mitigation**:

1. **Tiered limits**: Higher limits for authenticated requests vs. anonymous
2. **Burst allowance**: Sliding window with small burst buffer (e.g., 110% of limit for 10 seconds)
3. **Priority queuing**: VIP tenants get separate, higher limits
4. **Graceful 429 responses**: Include `Retry-After` header with exact reset time

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a production-ready foundation for building a cloud-agnostic image processing platform. The key insight is that image transformation is an ideal candidate for aggressive caching: transformations are pure functions (same inputs → same outputs), making content-addressed storage highly effective.

**Critical tradeoffs made in this design:**

1. **Synchronous-first over queue-first**: We accept higher p99 latency for small images in exchange for simpler client integration (no polling). For large images, we fall back to async.

2. **Efficiency locks over safety locks**: Redlock prevents duplicate work but doesn't guarantee mutual exclusion. This is acceptable because content-addressed storage ensures idempotency—duplicate transforms are wasteful, not dangerous.

3. **Edge authentication over origin-only**: Moving signature validation to the edge adds complexity but dramatically improves private content latency and reduces origin load.

4. **Storage tiering over uniform hot storage**: Cold storage introduces retrieval latency but reduces costs by 40-60% for infrequently accessed content.

**What this architecture does not cover:**

- Video transcoding (different latency characteristics, requires different chunking strategies)
- Real-time image editing (collaborative features, operational transforms)
- AI/ML-based transformations (background removal, upscaling—requires GPU infrastructure)
- Geographic data residency requirements (beyond standard CDN region configuration)

## Appendix

- Understanding of HTTP caching semantics (Cache-Control, ETags, CDN behavior)
- Basic knowledge of image formats and compression (JPEG, WebP, AVIF characteristics)
- Experience with at least one cloud provider's storage and CDN offerings

### Terminology

| Term                           | Definition                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Asset**                      | An original uploaded image, stored with its content hash                                      |
| **Derived Asset**              | A transformed version of an asset, identified by the hash of (original + operations)          |
| **Content-Addressed**          | Storage keyed by content hash rather than arbitrary ID; same content → same key               |
| **Fencing Token**              | Monotonically increasing token used to detect stale lock holders                              |
| **Operations Hash**            | SHA-256 of (canonical operation string + original content hash + output format)               |
| **Signed URL**                 | URL with cryptographic signature proving authorization; includes expiration timestamp         |
| **Storage Tier**               | Access latency class: hot (ms), warm (seconds), cold (minutes to hours)                       |
| **Transform Canonicalization** | Normalizing operation parameters to ensure equivalent transforms produce identical cache keys |

### Summary

- **Multi-layer caching** (CDN → Redis → Database → Storage) eliminates 99.9% of redundant processing
- **Content-addressed storage** with deterministic hashing ensures transform idempotency
- **Sharp (libvips 8.18)** provides 26x performance over alternatives with ~50MB memory footprint
- **AVIF** (94.89% browser support) offers 50% compression improvement over JPEG; WebP (95.93%) offers 25-34%
- **Redlock** is appropriate for efficiency optimization but not safety-critical mutual exclusion
- **Edge authentication** with normalized cache keys maximizes CDN hit rates for private content
- **Hierarchical policies** (Organization → Tenant → Space) enable flexible multi-tenant isolation
