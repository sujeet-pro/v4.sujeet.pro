# Draft: Rendering Strategies: CSR, SSR, SSG, and ISR

How rendering models affect performance, cost, and developer workflow.

## TLDR

- CSR favors interactivity but delays first paint
- SSR and SSG trade compute for faster initial render
- ISR blends freshness with static performance

## Outline

1. Rendering model definitions
2. Performance implications and caching
3. Personalization and auth constraints
4. SEO and metadata considerations
5. Operational costs and deployment complexity
6. Decision matrix by use case
