# Draft: CSS Architecture Strategies: BEM, Utility, and CSS-in-JS

Tradeoffs between naming conventions, utilities, and runtime styling approaches.

## TLDR

- Class strategy shapes maintainability and bundle size
- Utilities optimize for speed but need constraints
- CSS-in-JS enables co-location with runtime costs

## Outline

1. Goals: scale, consistency, and performance
2. BEM and naming conventions
3. Utility-first systems and design tokens
4. CSS-in-JS runtime vs build-time tradeoffs
5. Migration strategies between approaches
6. Decision framework for teams
