# Micro-Frontends Architecture: Composition, Isolation, and Delivery

Learn how to scale frontend development with microfrontends, enabling team autonomy, independent deployments, and domain-driven boundaries for large-scale applications.

## TLDR

**Microfrontends** break large frontend applications into smaller, independent pieces that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.

### Key Benefits

- **Team Autonomy**: Each team owns their microfrontend end-to-end
- **Technology Freedom**: Teams can choose different frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte)
- **Independent Deployments**: Deploy without coordinating with other teams
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organized around business domains, not technical layers

### Composition Strategies

- **Client-Side**: Browser assembly using Module Federation, Web Components, iframes
- **Server-Side**: Server assembly using SSR frameworks, Server-Side Includes
- **Edge-Side**: CDN assembly using Cloudflare Workers, ESI, Lambda@Edge

### Integration Techniques

- **Iframes**: Maximum isolation, complex communication via postMessage
- **Web Components**: Framework-agnostic, encapsulated UI widgets
- **Module Federation**: Dynamic code sharing, dependency optimization
- **Custom Events**: Simple publish-subscribe communication

### Deployment & State Management

- **Independent CI/CD pipelines** for each microfrontend
- **Local state first** - each microfrontend manages its own state
- **URL-based state** for sharing ephemeral data
- **Custom events** for cross-microfrontend communication

### When to Choose

- **Client-Side**: High interactivity, complex state sharing, SPA requirements
- **Edge-Side**: Global performance, low latency, high availability needs
- **Server-Side**: SEO-critical, initial load performance priority
- **Iframes**: Legacy integration, security sandboxing requirements

### Challenges

- **Cross-cutting concerns**: State management, routing, user experience
- **Performance overhead**: Multiple JavaScript bundles, network requests
- **Complexity**: Requires mature CI/CD, automation, and tooling
- **Team coordination**: Shared dependencies, versioning, integration testing

## Core Principles of Microfrontend Architecture

A successful microfrontend implementation is built on a foundation of core principles that ensure scalability and team independence.

### Technology Agnosticism

Each team should have the freedom to choose the technology stack best suited for their specific domain, without being constrained by the choices of other teams. Custom Elements are often used to create a neutral interface between these potentially disparate stacks.

### Isolate Team Code

To prevent the tight coupling that plagues monoliths, microfrontends should not share a runtime. Each should be built as an independent, self-contained application, avoiding reliance on shared state or global variables.

### Independent Deployments

A cornerstone of the architecture is the ability for each team to deploy their microfrontend independently. This decouples release cycles, accelerates feature delivery, and empowers teams with true ownership.

### Domain-Driven Boundaries

Microfrontends should be modeled around business domains, not technical layers. This ensures that teams are focused on delivering business value and that the boundaries between components are logical and clear.

## The Composition Conundrum: Where to Assemble the Puzzle?

The method by which independent microfrontends are stitched together into a cohesive user experience is known as composition. The location of this assembly process is a primary architectural decision, leading to three distinct models.

| Composition Strategy | Primary Location   | Key Technologies                                           | Ideal Use Case                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client-Side**      | User's Browser     | Module Federation, iframes, Web Components, single-spa     | Highly interactive, complex Single-Page Applications (SPAs) where teams are familiar with the frontend ecosystem                                      |
| **Server-Side**      | Origin Server      | Server-Side Includes (SSI), SSR Frameworks (e.g., Next.js) | SEO-critical applications where initial load performance is paramount and state-sharing complexity is high                                            |
| **Edge-Side**        | CDN / Edge Network | ESI, Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda@Edge                   | Applications with global audiences that require high availability, low latency, and the ability to offload scalability challenges to the CDN provider |

## A Deep Dive into Integration Techniques

The choice of composition model dictates the available integration techniques, each with its own set of trade-offs regarding performance, isolation, and developer experience.

### Client-Side Integration

In this model, an application shell is loaded in the browser, which then dynamically fetches and renders the various microfrontends.

#### Iframes: The Classic Approach

Iframes offer the strongest possible isolation in terms of styling and JavaScript execution. This makes them an excellent choice for integrating legacy applications or third-party content where trust is low. However, they introduce complexity in communication (requiring `postMessage` APIs) and can create a disjointed user experience.

```html collapse={1-20}
<!-- Example: Iframe-based microfrontend integration -->
<div class="app-shell">
  <header>
    <h1>E-commerce Platform</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <!-- Product catalog microfrontend -->
    <iframe
      src="https://catalog.microfrontend.com"
      id="catalog-frame"
      style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"
    >
    </iframe>

    <!-- Shopping cart microfrontend -->
    <iframe src="https://cart.microfrontend.com" id="cart-frame" style="width: 300px; height: 400px; border: none;">
    </iframe>
  </main>
</div>

<script>
  // Communication between iframes using postMessage
  document.getElementById("catalog-frame").contentWindow.postMessage(
    {
      type: "ADD_TO_CART",
      productId: "12345",
    },
    "https://catalog.microfrontend.com",
  )

  window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
    if (event.origin !== "https://cart.microfrontend.com") return

    if (event.data.type === "CART_UPDATED") {
      console.log("Cart updated:", event.data.cart)
    }
  })
</script>
```

#### Web Components: Framework-Agnostic Integration

By using a combination of Custom Elements and the Shadow DOM, Web Components provide a standards-based, framework-agnostic way to create encapsulated UI widgets. They serve as a neutral interface, allowing a React-based shell to seamlessly host a component built in Vue or Angular.

```javascript title="product-card.js" collapse={1-9, 14-36}
// Example: Custom Element for a product card microfrontend
class ProductCard extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" })
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    this.render()
  }

  render() {
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        .product-card {
          border: 1px solid #ddd;
          border-radius: 8px;
          padding: 16px;
          margin: 8px;
          max-width: 300px;
        }
        .product-title {
          font-size: 18px;
          font-weight: bold;
          margin-bottom: 8px;
        }
        .product-price {
          color: #e44d26;
          font-size: 20px;
          font-weight: bold;
        }
        .add-to-cart-btn {
          background: #007bff;
          color: white;
          border: none;
          padding: 8px 16px;
          border-radius: 4px;
          cursor: pointer;
        }
      </style>

      <div class="product-card">
        <div class="product-title">${this.getAttribute("title")}</div>
        <div class="product-price">$${this.getAttribute("price")}</div>
        <button class="add-to-cart-btn" onclick="this.addToCart()">
          Add to Cart
        </button>
      </div>
    `
  }

  // Key pattern: Custom events enable framework-agnostic communication
  addToCart() {
    this.dispatchEvent(
      new CustomEvent("addToCart", {
        detail: {
          productId: this.getAttribute("product-id"),
          title: this.getAttribute("title"),
          price: this.getAttribute("price"),
        },
        bubbles: true,
      }),
    )
  }
}

customElements.define("product-card", ProductCard)
```

#### Webpack Module Federation: Revolutionary Code Sharing

A revolutionary feature in Webpack 5+, Module Federation allows a JavaScript application to dynamically load code from a completely separate build at runtime. It enables true code sharing between independent applications.

**How it works:** A host application consumes code from a remote application. The remote exposes specific modules (like components or functions) via a `remoteEntry.js` file. Crucially, both can define shared dependencies (e.g., React), allowing the host and remote to negotiate and use a single version, preventing the library from being downloaded multiple times.

```javascript title="webpack.config.js (Host)" collapse={1-4}
// Host application webpack.config.js
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin")

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "host",
      remotes: {
        // Remote entry points - each microfrontend exposes its modules via remoteEntry.js
        productCatalog: "productCatalog@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js",
        shoppingCart: "shoppingCart@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js",
      },
      shared: {
        // singleton: true ensures only one React instance across all microfrontends
        react: { singleton: true, requiredVersion: "^18.0.0" },
        "react-dom": { singleton: true, requiredVersion: "^18.0.0" },
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

```javascript title="webpack.config.js (Remote)" collapse={1-4}
// Remote application webpack.config.js
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin")

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "productCatalog",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      exposes: {
        // Components exposed to consuming applications
        "./ProductList": "./src/components/ProductList",
        "./ProductCard": "./src/components/ProductCard",
      },
      shared: {
        react: { singleton: true, requiredVersion: "^18.0.0" },
        "react-dom": { singleton: true, requiredVersion: "^18.0.0" },
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

```javascript title="App.jsx (Host)"
// Host application consuming remote components
import React, { Suspense } from "react"

// Dynamic imports load remote microfrontends at runtime
const ProductList = React.lazy(() => import("productCatalog/ProductList"))
const ShoppingCart = React.lazy(() => import("shoppingCart/ShoppingCart"))

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading products...</div>}>
        <ProductList />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading cart...</div>}>
        <ShoppingCart />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Use Case:** This is the dominant technique for building complex, interactive SPAs that feel like a single, cohesive application. It excels at optimizing bundle sizes through dependency sharing and enables rich, integrated state management. The trade-off is tighter coupling at the JavaScript level, requiring teams to coordinate on shared dependency versions.

### Edge-Side Integration

This hybrid model moves the assembly logic from the origin server to the CDN layer, physically closer to the end-user.

#### Edge Side Includes (ESI): Legacy XML-Based Assembly

A legacy XML-based markup language, ESI allows an edge proxy to stitch a page together from fragments with different caching policies. An `<esi:include>` tag in the HTML instructs the ESI processor to fetch and inject content from another URL.

```html
<!-- Example: ESI-based page assembly -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>E-commerce Platform</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/main.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <esi:include src="https://header.microfrontend.com" />
    </header>

    <main>
      <div class="product-catalog">
        <esi:include src="https://catalog.microfrontend.com/products" />
      </div>

      <aside class="shopping-cart">
        <esi:include src="https://cart.microfrontend.com" />
      </aside>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <esi:include src="https://footer.microfrontend.com" />
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

While effective for caching, ESI is limited by its declarative nature and inconsistent vendor support.

#### Programmable Edge: Modern JavaScript-Based Assembly

The modern successor to ESI, programmable edge environments provide a full JavaScript runtime on the CDN. Using APIs like Cloudflare's `HTMLRewriter`, a worker can stream an application shell, identify placeholder elements, and stream microfrontend content directly into them from different origins.

```javascript title="worker.js" collapse={1-5}
// Example: Cloudflare Worker for edge-side composition
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url)

    // Fetch the application shell from origin
    const shellResponse = await fetch("https://shell.microfrontend.com" + url.pathname)

    // Fetch microfrontend fragments in parallel
    const [headerHtml, catalogHtml, cartHtml] = await Promise.all([
      fetch("https://header.microfrontend.com").then((r) => r.text()),
      fetch("https://catalog.microfrontend.com/products").then((r) => r.text()),
      fetch("https://cart.microfrontend.com").then((r) => r.text()),
    ])

    // Use HTMLRewriter to inject microfrontend content into placeholders
    return new HTMLRewriter()
      .on('[data-microfrontend="header"]', {
        element(el) {
          el.replace(headerHtml, { html: true })
        },
      })
      .on('[data-microfrontend="catalog"]', {
        element(el) {
          el.replace(catalogHtml, { html: true })
        },
      })
      .on('[data-microfrontend="cart"]', {
        element(el) {
          el.replace(cartHtml, { html: true })
        },
      })
      .transform(shellResponse)
  },
}
```

This approach offers the performance benefits of server-side rendering with the scalability of a global CDN. A powerful pattern called "Fragment Piercing" even allows for the incremental modernization of legacy client-side apps by server-rendering new microfrontends at the edge and "piercing" them into the existing application's DOM.

## Deployment Strategies: From Code to Production

A core tenet of microfrontends is independent deployability, which necessitates a robust and automated CI/CD strategy.

### Independent Pipelines

Each microfrontend must have its own dedicated CI/CD pipeline, allowing its owning team to build, test, and deploy without coordinating with others. This is fundamental to achieving team autonomy.

<figure>

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Team A - Product Catalog"
        A1[Code Push] --> A2[Build & Test]
        A2 --> A3[Deploy to Staging]
        A3 --> A4[Integration Tests]
        A4 --> A5[Deploy to Production]
    end

    subgraph "Team B - Shopping Cart"

    end

    B5 -.-> D
    C5 -.-> D
```

<figcaption>Independent deployment pipelines showing how each team can build, test, and deploy their microfrontend without coordinating with others</figcaption>

</figure>

### Repository Strategy

Teams often face a choice between a single monorepo or multiple repositories (polyrepo). A monorepo can simplify dependency management and ensure consistency, but it can also reduce team autonomy and create tight coupling if not managed carefully.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy-catalog.yml" collapse={1-6, 14-36}
# Example: GitHub Actions workflow for independent deployment
name: Deploy Product Catalog Microfrontend

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      # Key pattern: Only trigger when this specific microfrontend changes
      - "microfrontends/product-catalog/**"

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"
          cache-dependency-path: "microfrontends/product-catalog/package-lock.json"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd microfrontends/product-catalog
          npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd microfrontends/product-catalog
          npm test

      - name: Build application
        run: |
          cd microfrontends/product-catalog
          npm run build

      # Independent deployment - no coordination with other teams
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: npm run deploy:staging
        working-directory: microfrontends/product-catalog

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration

      - name: Deploy to production
        if: success()
        run: npm run deploy:production
        working-directory: microfrontends/product-catalog
```

### Automation and Tooling

A mature automation culture is non-negotiable.

**Selective Builds:** CI/CD systems should be intelligent enough to identify and build only the components that have changed, avoiding unnecessary full-application rebuilds.

**Versioning:** Shared dependencies and components must be strictly versioned to prevent conflicts and allow teams to adopt updates at their own pace.

**Infrastructure:** Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are often used to manage and scale the various services that constitute the microfrontend ecosystem.

## Navigating Cross-Cutting Concerns

While decomposition solves many problems, it introduces new challenges, particularly around state, routing, and user experience.

### State Management and Communication

Managing state is one of the most complex aspects of a microfrontend architecture. The primary goal is to maintain isolation and avoid re-introducing the tight coupling the architecture was meant to solve.

#### Local State First

The default and most resilient pattern is for each microfrontend to manage its own state independently.

```javascript title="ProductCatalog.jsx" collapse={1-3, 11-24}
// Example: Local state management in a React microfrontend
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react"

function ProductCatalog() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([])
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({})

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProducts(filters)
  }, [filters])

  const fetchProducts = async (filters) => {
    setLoading(true)
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/products?${new URLSearchParams(filters)}`)
      const data = await response.json()
      setProducts(data)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch products:", error)
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  // Key pattern: Sync local state to URL for shareability
  const handleFilterChange = (newFilters) => {
    setFilters(newFilters)
    window.history.replaceState(null, "", `?${new URLSearchParams(newFilters)}`)
  }

  return (
    <div className="product-catalog">
      <FilterPanel filters={filters} onFilterChange={handleFilterChange} />
      {loading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <ProductGrid products={products} />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### URL-Based State

For ephemeral state that needs to be shared across fragments (e.g., search filters), the URL is the ideal, stateless medium.

```javascript title="url-state-manager.js" collapse={1-6, 27-36}
// Example: URL-based state management
class URLStateManager {
  constructor() {
    this.listeners = new Set()
    window.addEventListener("popstate", this.handlePopState.bind(this))
  }

  // Key pattern: URL as the source of truth for cross-microfrontend state
  setState(key, value) {
    const url = new URL(window.location)
    if (value === null || value === undefined) {
      url.searchParams.delete(key)
    } else {
      url.searchParams.set(key, JSON.stringify(value))
    }
    window.history.pushState(null, "", url)
    this.notifyListeners()
  }

  getState(key) {
    const url = new URL(window.location)
    const value = url.searchParams.get(key)
    return value ? JSON.parse(value) : null
  }

  subscribe(listener) {
    this.listeners.add(listener)
    return () => this.listeners.delete(listener)
  }

  notifyListeners() {
    this.listeners.forEach((listener) => listener())
  }

  handlePopState() {
    this.notifyListeners()
  }
}

// Usage across microfrontends - any microfrontend can read/write
const stateManager = new URLStateManager()
stateManager.setState("category", "electronics")
const category = stateManager.getState("category")
```

#### Custom Events

For client-side communication after composition, native browser events provide a simple and effective publish-subscribe mechanism, allowing fragments to communicate without direct knowledge of one another.

```javascript title="event-bus.js" collapse={1-26}
// Example: Event-based communication between microfrontends
class MicrofrontendEventBus {
  constructor() {
    this.events = {}
  }

  on(event, callback) {
    if (!this.events[event]) {
      this.events[event] = []
    }
    this.events[event].push(callback)
  }

  emit(event, data) {
    if (this.events[event]) {
      this.events[event].forEach((callback) => callback(data))
    }
  }

  off(event, callback) {
    if (this.events[event]) {
      this.events[event] = this.events[event].filter((cb) => cb !== callback)
    }
  }
}

window.microfrontendEvents = new MicrofrontendEventBus()

// Key pattern: Loose coupling via pub-sub
// Product catalog emits events (doesn't know who listens)
function addToCart(product) {
  window.microfrontendEvents.emit("addToCart", {
    productId: product.id,
    name: product.name,
    price: product.price,
    quantity: 1,
  })
}

// Shopping cart subscribes (doesn't know who publishes)
window.microfrontendEvents.on("addToCart", (productData) => {
  updateCart(productData)

#### Shared Global Store (Use with Caution)

For truly global state like user authentication, a shared store (e.g., Redux) can be used. However, this should be a last resort, as it introduces a strong dependency between fragments and the shared module, reducing modularity.

```javascript title="shared-store.js" collapse={1-4, 8-16, 19-32}
// Example: Shared Redux store (use sparingly - reduces modularity)
import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux"

// Shared user state - authentication is a valid use case for shared state
const userReducer = (state = null, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_USER":
      return action.payload
    case "LOGOUT":
      return null
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Shared cart state - consider URL-based or event-based alternatives first
const cartReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TO_CART":
      const existingItem = state.find((item) => item.id === action.payload.id)
      if (existingItem) {
        return state.map((item) => (item.id === action.payload.id ? { ...item, quantity: item.quantity + 1 } : item))
      }
      return [...state, { ...action.payload, quantity: 1 }]
    case "REMOVE_FROM_CART":
      return state.filter((item) => item.id !== action.payload)
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const rootReducer = combineReducers({ user: userReducer, cart: cartReducer })

// Warning: All microfrontends now depend on this store version
window.sharedStore = createStore(rootReducer)
```

### Routing

Routing logic is intrinsically tied to the composition model.

#### Client-Side Routing

In architectures using an application shell (common with Module Federation or single-spa), a global router within the shell manages navigation between different microfrontends, while each microfrontend can handle its own internal, nested routes.

```javascript title="root-config.js" collapse={16-32}
// Example: Client-side routing with single-spa
import { registerApplication, start } from "single-spa"

// Key pattern: Route-based microfrontend mounting
// Each microfrontend mounts/unmounts based on URL patterns
registerApplication({
  name: "product-catalog",
  app: () => import("./product-catalog"),
  activeWhen: ["/products", "/"],
  customProps: { domElement: document.getElementById("product-catalog-container") },
})

registerApplication({
  name: "shopping-cart",
  app: () => import("./shopping-cart"),
  activeWhen: ["/cart"],
  customProps: { domElement: document.getElementById("shopping-cart-container") },
})

registerApplication({
  name: "user-profile",
  app: () => import("./user-profile"),
  activeWhen: ["/profile"],
  customProps: { domElement: document.getElementById("user-profile-container") },
})

start()
```

#### Server/Edge-Side Routing

In server or edge-composed systems, routing is typically handled by the webserver or edge worker. Each URL corresponds to a page that is assembled from a specific set of fragments, simplifying the client-side logic at the cost of a full network round trip for each navigation.

```javascript title="pages/products/[category].js" collapse={13-24}
// Example: Server-side routing with Next.js
export default function ProductCategory({ products, category }) {
  return (
    <div className="product-category-page">
      <h1>{category} Products</h1>
      {/* Microfrontend components composed server-side */}
      <ProductCatalog products={products} />
      <ShoppingCart />
    </div>
  )
}

// Key pattern: Data fetched at request time, page assembled server-side
export async function getServerSideProps({ params }) {
  const { category } = params
  const products = await fetchProductsByCategory(category)
  return { props: { products, category } }
}
```

## Choosing Your Path: A Use-Case Driven Analysis

The "best" microfrontend approach is context-dependent. The decision should be driven by application requirements, team structure, and performance goals.

### Choose Client-Side Composition (e.g., Module Federation) when:

- Your application is a highly interactive, complex SPA that needs to feel like a single, seamless product
- Multiple fragments need to share complex state
- Optimizing the total JavaScript payload via dependency sharing is a key concern
- Teams are familiar with the frontend ecosystem and can coordinate on shared dependencies

### Choose Edge-Side Composition when:

- Your primary goals are global low latency, high availability, and superior initial load performance
- You're building e-commerce sites, news portals, or any application serving a geographically diverse audience
- Offloading scalability to a CDN is a strategic advantage
- You need to incrementally modernize legacy applications

### Choose Server-Side Composition when:

- SEO and initial page load time are the absolute highest priorities
- You're building content-heavy sites with less dynamic interactivity
- Delivering a fully-formed HTML document to web crawlers is critical
- State-sharing complexity is high and you want to avoid client-side coordination

### Choose Iframes when:

- You need to integrate a legacy application into a modern shell
- You're embedding untrusted third-party content
- The unparalleled security sandboxing of iframes is required
- You need complete isolation between different parts of the application

## Conclusion

Microfrontends enable scalable frontend development but introduce complexity that must be justified by organizational needs. The architecture works best when:

- **Multiple teams** need to deploy independently without coordination
- **Technology diversity** is required across different parts of the application
- **Domain boundaries** are clear and stable

The composition strategy should match your constraints: client-side for SPAs with complex state sharing, edge-side for global performance requirements, server-side for SEO-critical applications.

Microfrontends are fundamentally an organizational decision. The technical implementation follows from how teams are structured, how releases are managed, and what trade-offs are acceptable. Start with the simplest approach that enables independent deployment, then add complexity only when needed.
