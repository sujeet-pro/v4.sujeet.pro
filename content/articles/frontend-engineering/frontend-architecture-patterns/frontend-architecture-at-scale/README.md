# Draft: Frontend Architecture at Scale: Boundaries and Ownership

How large teams organize UI codebases, ownership, and release workflows.

## TLDR

- Clear boundaries reduce coordination and dependency churn
- Ownership models determine build and release speed
- Cross-cutting concerns need shared contracts

## Outline

1. Domain-driven UI boundaries
2. Team ownership and release models
3. Shared contracts (design tokens, APIs, schemas)
4. Build and dependency strategies
5. Governance vs autonomy tradeoffs
6. Scaling checklists and pitfalls
