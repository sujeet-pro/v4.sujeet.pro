# Draft: Design Tokens and Theming Architecture

How to model, store, and distribute design tokens across platforms.

## TLDR

- Tokens create a single source of truth for design decisions
- Theming requires semantic layering and fallback strategies
- Automation prevents drift across platforms

## Outline

1. Token taxonomy and naming conventions
2. Semantic vs raw tokens
3. Theming and mode switching
4. Distribution pipelines and versioning
5. Tooling and governance
6. Migration and adoption strategies
