# Draft: Core Web Vitals Measurement: Lab vs Field

How to measure, interpret, and improve Core Web Vitals in production.

## TLDR

- Field data reflects real users; lab data speeds iteration
- INP, LCP, and CLS require different diagnostics
- RUM pipelines are essential for ongoing visibility

## Outline

1. Metric definitions and thresholds
2. Lab tooling and synthetic testing
3. Field data collection and RUM
4. Diagnostics by metric (LCP, INP, CLS)
5. Alerting and regression detection
6. Reporting and continuous improvement
