# Draft: Heaps and Priority Queues

Efficient structures for scheduling, ranking, and selection problems.

## TLDR

- Heaps give O(log n) insert/delete with O(1) peek
- Priority queues power schedulers and shortest path
- Binary heaps are a simple, practical default

## Outline

1. Heap properties and operations
2. Priority queue use cases
3. Binary vs Fibonacci heap tradeoffs
4. Implementation details and pitfalls
5. Complexity analysis
6. Practice problems
