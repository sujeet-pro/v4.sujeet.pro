# Draft: Arrays and Hash Maps: Tradeoffs and Use Cases

Fundamental data structures with real-world performance considerations.

## TLDR

- Arrays excel at contiguous access and cache locality
- Hash maps provide fast lookups with memory overhead
- Real performance depends on load factor and collisions

## Outline

1. Time and space complexity overview
2. Array operations and patterns
3. Hash map mechanics and collisions
4. Iteration and ordering tradeoffs
5. Practical use cases
6. Common pitfalls
