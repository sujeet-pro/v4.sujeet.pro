# Draft: Documentation Templates and Standards

Templates that improve consistency across technical docs.

## TLDR

- Templates reduce ambiguity and onboarding time
- Docs should mirror how systems are operated
- Ownership and review keep docs current

## Outline

1. Doc types and audiences
2. Architecture decision records
3. Runbooks and operational docs
4. API and integration docs
5. Onboarding and knowledge base
6. Governance and review cadence
